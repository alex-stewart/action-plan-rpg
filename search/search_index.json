Game Cycle The Game Master should decide the schedule for action plan submission. It's recommended to have 1-3, evenly spaced apart, action plan submissions each week. Flowchart Actions can be complicated, with multiple steps, they should be submitted in the form of a flowchart. At the end of the day, the Game Master will evaluate each action plan and determine the outcomes depending on the number of characters participating, with bonuses given for matching archetypes. The Game Master should report results of each action plan in public, private or a combination of both. Minor Actions Certain minor actions can be taken for free, such as trading items, eating and reading a letter. Minor actions can be taken at any time.

Examples include a tribe of cavemen, a band of apocalypse survivors or a biker gang. Archetypes Archetypes are the categories of character a play can choose to create, which create speciality with little complexity. The Game Master can create any number of archetypes, but they should be distinct and fit the theme of your game. For example, in a medieval court setting you may have the archetypes; knight, monk and spy. When a player creates a character, they should select a character archetype. Agendas Agendas are objectives for characters, designed to encourage natural disagreement. Agendas are scored on the collective meeting the criteria and not the individual. A good set of agendas would contain opposing ideas. Some examples of agendas for a tribe of goblins: Hoarding treasure Destroying non-goblin settlements Building monuments to the goblin god When a player creates a character, the Game Master should assign an agenda. Karma Each time an agenda condition is met by the collective as a whole (not just the individual), the characters with that agenda will receive karma. Karma is hidden from all players until that character dies when it becomes public information. The amount of karma for an action is not fixed and up to the Game master to decide. The more characters meeting the conditions of the agenda, the greater the karma. Death A character which dies is removed from the game, the player may be given the choice to create a new character.","title":"Characters"},{"location":"rules/characters/#characters","text":"","title":"Characters"},{"location":"rules/characters/#the-collective","text":"The collective is the group in which the player characters belong to.
