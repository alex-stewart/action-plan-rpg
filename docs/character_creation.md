# Character Creation

## Archetypes

The Game Master will decide the character archetypes available to the players.
When a player creates a character, they should select a character archetype.
Character archetypes are public information.

## Agendas

The Game Master will assign the character a secret agenda.
Agendas are private information.

### Karma
Each time an agenda condition is met by the collective as a whole (not just the individual), the characters with that agenda will receive karma. 
Karma is hidden from all players until that character dies when it becomes public information.
The amount of karma for an action is not fixed and up to the Game master to decide.
The more characters meeting the conditions of the agenda, the greater the karma.

## Death
Certain actions, when failed, may have dire consequences.
A character which dies is removed from the game, the player may be given the choice to create a new character.

## Hunger
Without food, players will die, one unit of food will feed a single character for a week.
At the end of the week the Game Master will determine which characters have died of starvation.
Players must declare that they are eating as a minor action, as the Game Master cannot assume players are sharing nicely.
