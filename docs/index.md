# Overview

Players play as characters in a collective trying to survive.
Players gain points (karma) by completing their hidden agendas.
Individual characters are weak, and should work together as a team by submitting and participating in action plans.

One real-time week plays out the events of two in-game days.
In a regular week players will have the option to submit or participate in an action plan twice.
