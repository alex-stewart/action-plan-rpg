# Game Creation

When setting up a new game, it's for the Game Master to decide the parameters.

## The Collective

The collective is the group in which the player characters belong to.
Examples include a tribe of cavemen, a band of apocalypse survivors or a biker gang.

## Archetypes

Archetypes are the categories of character a play can choose to create, which create speciality with little complexity.
The Game Master can create any number of archetypes, but they should be distinct and fit the theme of your game.

For example, in a medieval court setting you may have the following archetypes: 
- Knight
- Monk
- Spy

## Agendas

Agendas are objectives for characters, designed to encourage natural disagreement.
Agendas are scored on the collective meeting the criteria and not the individual.
The Game Master will have to decide if they will allow players to be a part of the agenda assignment process.
If the Game Master is deciding the agendas themselves, it's advised to have a list of potential agendas and randomise them.
A good set of agendas would contain opposing ideas.

Some examples of agendas for a tribe of goblins:
- Hoarding treasure
- Destroying non-goblin settlements
- Building monuments to the goblin god


## Action Plans

The Game Master should decide the schedule of action plans.

It's recommended to have 1-3 action plan submissions per week, depending on the eagerness of your players.
