# Playing the Game

## Action Plans

### Game Cycle

Each week will have two designated action days specified by the Game Master.

On these days, a player may:

- Propose a new action plan publicly or privately.

- Participate in an proposed action plan.

### Flowchart

Complex actions with multiple steps should be submitted in the form of a flowchart.

At the end of the day, the game master will evaluate each action plan and determine the outcomes depending on the number of characters participating, with bonuses given for matching archetypes. Results of each action plan will be reported either publicly or privately at the Game Masters decision.

### Variations

When participating in an action plan, players may add a minor variation in public or in private.
Variations with high impact are unlikely to succeed.

## Minor Actions

Certain minor actions can be taken for free, such as trading items, eating and reading a letter.
Minor actions can be taken at any time.
The minor action should not assume to be successful until the Game Master has responded success/failure.
