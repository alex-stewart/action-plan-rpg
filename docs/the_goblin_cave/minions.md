# Minions

Players can pray to the Goblin God to spawn a minion with a specific purpose.
A minion is a smaller creature, weaker than a goblin which can perform a specific task continuously without complaint.
For example, a minion might be spawned to maintain the caves mushroom farm, or cook meat.
Like goblins, minions require one food unit per week.
