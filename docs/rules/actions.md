# Playing the Game

## Action Plan Submission

During Action Plan Submission, a player may either:
- Propose a new action plan publicly or privately.
- Participate in an proposed action plan.

### Game Cycle

The Game Master should decide the schedule for action plan submission.
It's recommended to have 1-3, evenly spaced apart, action plan submissions each week.


### Flowchart

Actions can be complicated, with multiple steps, they should be submitted in the form of a flowchart.
At the end of the day, the Game Master will evaluate each action plan and determine the outcomes depending on the number of characters participating, with bonuses given for matching archetypes. 
The Game Master should report results of each action plan in public, private or a combination of both.

## Minor Actions

Certain minor actions can be taken for free, such as trading items, eating and reading a letter.
Minor actions can be taken at any time.
Success and failure should be confirmed by the Game Master.
